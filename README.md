# Social Network API
## Description
The purpose of this social media application is for users to create an account, make friends, post thoughts, and post reactions to those thoughts. There is no seed data for this application, so the first step is to create a user. Creating a user requires a username and email and from there the user can update their information, or delete their account all together. Ther user can also post a thought, which is essentially a social media post. The user can then update or delete that thought. A user can also add a reaction which essentially acts like a comment on a social media post. A user can add areaction to any post thats in the database. The user can also add and remove other users from their friend list. This program utilizes mongodb for the database and express routing.
